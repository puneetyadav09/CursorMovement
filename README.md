**Introduction**

This Python project combines object detection with cursor movement, providing an interactive and intuitive way to interact with detected objects on the screen. The application uses computer vision techniques to identify objects in real-time and maps cursor movement based on the detected object's positions.

**Features**

**Object Detection:** Utilizes a pre-trained model to detect objects in the camera feed.
**Cursor Movement:** Maps the cursor's movement to the positions of detected objects.
**Real-time Interaction:** Enjoy a dynamic and interactive experience as the cursor responds to the movement of detected objects.
**Configurability:** Easily configure the sensitivity and mapping parameters for optimal user experience.

**Installation**

To run this application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Puneet-Yadav-001/CursorMovement.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd object-detection-cursor-movement

3. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the application:
python main.py

**Usage**

1. Launch the application by running main.py.
2. The camera feed will start, and objects will be detected in real-time.
3. Move detected objects to control the cursor on the screen.

**Dependencies**

1. Python 3. 12
2. OpenCV

Please ensure you have the required dependencies installed before running the application.
